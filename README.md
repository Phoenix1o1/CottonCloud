# CottonCloud
As the title said this is the code for a Cotton Cloud.
Once that is lined up with WS2812 inside, it makes for a great bedside lamp.
It has the ability to stick to a single colour, to show a moving rainbow or to simulate a thundertorm using a complete garbage call of randoms inside of other randoms. Don't judge me.

## Hardware
The instructions should be fairly simple, i'll put up drawings eventually, but there are a lot of instructables on how to build a cloud shaped cotton lamp.

## Electronics
Required materials are an arduino (any'll do), a push button, and a bunch of WS2812 leds.
